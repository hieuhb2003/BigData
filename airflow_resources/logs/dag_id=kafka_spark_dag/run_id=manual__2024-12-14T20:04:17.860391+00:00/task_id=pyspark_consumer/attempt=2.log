 of the same consumer group. Restarted queries may also suffer interference from the
 previous run having the same group id. The user should have only one query per group id,
 and/or set the option 'kafka.session.timeout.ms' to be very small so that the Kafka
 consumers from the previous query are marked dead by the Kafka group coordinator before the

 not recommended to set this option. This option is unsafe to use since multiple concurrent
 queries or sources using the same group id will interfere with each other as they are part
 of the same consumer group. Restarted queries may also suffer interference from the
 previous run having the same group id. The user should have only one query per group id,
 and/or set the option 'kafka.session.timeout.ms' to be very small so that the Kafka
 consumers from the previous query are marked dead by the Kafka group coordinator before the
 restarted query starts running.
